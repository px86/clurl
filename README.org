#+TITLE: clurl - URL Shortener written in Common Lisp
#+AUTHOR: Pushkar Raj
#+EMAIL: px86@protonmail.com

Yet another URL Shortener written in Common Lisp, (using PostgreSQL database). This is my first ever Common Lisp project. So, there is a high probability that the code will suck!.

To build,

#+begin_src shell
  make
#+end_src

To run,

#+begin_src shell
  ./clurl
#+end_src


* Environment Variables
These environment variables should be set (before starting the application), to establish a connection to a running PostgreSQL instance.

- =CLURL_HOST=
- =CLURL_PORT=
- =CLURL_DB=
- =CLURL_USERNAME=
- =CLURL_PASSWORD=
